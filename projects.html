        <p>Our laboratory is dedicated to developing and applying mathematical, statistical, and computational models that can address various problems in biomedicine, epidemiology, and engineering. We employ multiple methods, such as data science, deterministic models, machine learning, and biostatistics models, to model, predict, understand, and solve these problems. We also create software tools and virtual laboratories that allow the visualization and testing of hypotheses through mathematical models that are accessible and easy to use for non-experts in mathematics and
computing techniques. In addition, our laboratory is committed to fostering a culture of interdisciplinary collaboration among various experts in biological science, engineering, mathematics, and computer science. We work closely with PIs from the Hormel Institutes, the University of Minnesota, and other scientific and educational institutions to address complex biological and engineering problems. Our laboratory aims to advance several branches of science by developing and applying novel models, software, and techniques that can handle large-scale and high-dimensional.
data.</p>
        <p> Currently, our laboratory is involved in various projects, including the following: </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
            <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Developing and applying a novel mathematical and computational framework for modeling and analyzing the dynamics and control of infectious diseases in heterogeneous populations. This work aims to create more advanced and realistic mathematical models to capture infectious diseasesâ€™ complexity, diversity, and transmission dynamics. The project will contribute to the understanding and forecasting of epidemics such as <strong><mark class="highlighted-text">COVID-19, HIV, Dengue fever, and information diffusion</mark></strong>.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Developing a <strong><mark class="highlighted-text">web-based platform</mark></strong> that simplifies and streamlines the use of SIR models for any scientific domain. With our project, you can easily upload your data, select the most suitable SIR model, customize the parameters, and run the model in minutes. You can then analyze the results in an interactive dashboard, where you can see how well the model fits your data, how the model predicts the future behavior of your system, and how sensitive the model is to different parameter values.</li>
            <li style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Developing and applying mathematical models to analyze composite and fluid materials in various contexts. One of the main objectives is to investigate the behavior and properties of electroelastic materials, which can deform under electric fields and generate electric fields under mechanical stress. These materials have potential applications in <strong><mark class="highlighted-text">tissue self-repair, prostheses, and energy harvesting</mark></strong>, as they can mimic the natural functions of biological tissues and organs. Another objective is to use modeling techniques of composite materials, such as homogenization and multiscale methods, to study the growth and dynamics of solid tumors. These studies can help understand the interactions between tumor cells and their microenvironment and design better diagnosis and treatment strategies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> The laboratory is involved in several projects within the Hormel Institute and with external partners focusing on different cancer and nutrition research aspects. These projects include simulating cancer cell growth, developing a computational framework for the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and studying the relationship between food diversity and nutritional quality.</p>
